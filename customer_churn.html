										<h1>Customer Churn</h1>

									<h2>Introduction</h2>

									<p>Churn modelling involves predicting when a customer has stopped purchasing a product/servivce. The actual definition of churn depends on the product and industry. If the service is a subscription, a customer churns when they cancel the service. If the product is something the customer buys on occasion, such as takeout, then churn could mean not making a purchase for a certain number of weeks. </p>
									<p>Churn models help businesses identify the customers they are most likely to use, so that the business can invest appropriately to try and retain that customer.</p>
									<p>This project involved building a customer churn model for a large delivery company, which operated in 12 different countries at the time. Given a set budget, the model would be able to identify which customers to spend money on in retention campaigns. Such models are often used in conjunction with customer lifetime value models, which estimate how much a customer is likely to spend over a set period and serves as a good measure of a customer's value to a business.</p>

									<h2>Objective</h2>
									<p>The goal of the project was to maximise retention (or conversely, minimise churn), per euro invested in promotional campaigns. The general idea is that targeting customers with a high probability of churning and offering them promotions will incentivise future purchases through habit building and helping the customer find more restaurants that they like.</p>
									<p>If we offer promotions to customers who are unlikely to churn, these customers will use the promotional offers but probably would have made a purchase anyway, which results in a loss for the company. </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Challenges</h2>
									<p>Customer purchasing data is often very noisy. A customer may churn because they have started using a competitor, gone on holiday or simply decided to save money. Because of this, it can be difficult to validate churn models, especially if the company has a diverse customer base, low order volumes or a naturally low conversion rate. A/B testing is a common technique used to verify whether an improvement in retention is 'statistically significant', and in each of the cases defined in the previous sentence, a large sample size may be required which can take weeks to achieve. When running large tests for extended time periods, testing can become very expensive, so it is important that the test is planned properly and results are obtained on the first attempt.</p>
									<p></p>

									<h2>Methodology</h2>
									<p>The first step in such projects is usually always to explore the data and try to understand what factors are most important in regards to churn. In the food delivery space, increases in price, lack of options and competitors are often very important. High value customers usually have specific purchasing patterns, like ordering every sunday, so changes in their purchasing pattern are also key indicators of churn.</p>
									<p>After identifying key features and building a dataset, a list of candidate models were identified based on the amount/quality of the data available. If the data is lacking in either of these factors, simpler models are preferred, as more complex models require an abundance of high quality data to correctly capture the patterns we are looking for. In this case, there was an abundance of high quality data, so we were able to experiment with some deep learning architectures alongside more traditional models such as XGBoost.</p>
									<p>A review of recent literature on churn revealed that a convolutional neural network, feeding into a LSTM layer, provided improvements in performance when compared with traditional modelling techniques. While this gave a slight improvement over an XGBoost model in terms of correct churn predictions, the lack of explainability of such a model made it an unfavourable option, because we cannot employ tools such as SHAP, which tell us why a model made a prediction. Knowing why a model made a particular prediction is important in churn modelling because these 'themes' are something that we can track over time to improve business understanding around churn.</p>
									<p>After deciding on XGBoost, and optimising model parameters, the model probabilities were compared against real examples to confirm that the churn probability output by the model is accurate. If the model says 20% likely to churn, we can find all other customers who were predicted 20%, and calculate at the churn rate of that group. If the churn rate is close to 20%, then we know that the model probabilites are representative of the real world. If this is not the case, we need to take additional steps to 'calibrate' the model. This is known as probability calibration.</p>

									<h2>Testing / Validation</h2>
									<p>Testing the churn model involved designing an A/B test, in which a certain amount of budget was allocated to promotions (money off a customer's next order). In the control group, these promotions were given at random, and in the test group only customers with a high churn probability are selected.</p>
									<p>Using the expected improvement in retention and current retention rates, we are able to calculate the sample size required to achieve statistical significance. Based on the numbers of customers we expect to go into the test each week, we can estimate the number of weeks that the test needs to run for, and the cost of running the test.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Results</h2>
									<p>Without any spend, the churn rate at the business as 41.3%. After spending €20K at random (control group), the churn rate decreased to 40.2%. After selecting customers with a high churn probability, the churn rate decreased further to 39.3%. This means we can get a 1.1% improvement in churn rate per €20K when selecting customers at random, which increases to 2% when using the churn model. This equates to (almost) a doubling in the effectiveness of the marketting budget.</p>
