									<p>Glovo is a delivery startup based in Barcelona, where I lived for a number of years, working as a Data Scientist. Since its early days as a small player, it rose to become one of the leading companies in the space, and was purchased by DeliveryHero for $2.3 billion in 2022.</p>

									<ul>
										<li><p>Immersed in a world of extremely talented people. Witnessed the company grow from ~200 to 1500 employees.</p></li>
										<li><p>Developed and owned models for customer churn and customer lifetime value, which were primarily used in customer marketing and were rolled out across 23 countries</p></li>
										<li><p>Developed a predictive model with a hybrid LSTM/CNN architecture, capable of extracting valuable information from temporal customer data and predicting many different targets, including churn, order propensity, lifetime value and time until next order. The aim of this modular architecture was to do the work of many data scientists in a single project</p></li>
										<li><p>I was also part of the data science production team, which helped other data scientists transfer their models to the company's machine learning platform. Primarily, I helped with refactoring code, building tests and coordinating resources with the Machine Learning Platform team</p></li>
										<li><p>Key driver of a second machine learning platform for fast deployment to AWS for development projects. This platform significantly reduced the deployment time of projects, allowing Data Scientists to launch a development project for testing purposes without having to go spend lots of time and resources deploying their model to the main machine learning platform</p></li>
										<li><p>Active speaker in the data science community, having given a talk on productionising models at the BarcelonaR data science meetup, as well as helping the group to host a second event at Glovo's headquarters</p></li>
										<li><p>Key Technologies: Python, R, Looker, Plotly, Dash, XGBoost, Tensorflow, CNN, LSTM, Docker, Pytest, AWS, SageMaker, S3, Athena, Redshift, Glue, Jenkins, CI/CD.</p></li>
