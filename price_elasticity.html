									<p>In this project, the client was a retailer with a huge catalogue of products. There was a need to increase prices to improve margins, but after increasing prices on some products, the client experienced a huge drop in order volumes. In pricing terms, we would say that such products have a high price sensitivity (also referred to as elasticity).</p>

									<p>A product with high price sensitivity will experience large changes in order volumes, even for small perturbations in price. There can be many factors that contribute to this, including the product category, competitor pricing, demand for the product (which may change over time), supply (within the company and competitors), quality tier (whether the product is seem as cheap, mid range or high end) and more.</p>

									<p>Usually, many of these factors are at play at the same time, making it difficult to discern the importance of each factor to a products price elasticity. Thankfully, with enough data and machine learning expertise, it is often possible to determine which products are the most/least price elastic and why. The extent to which we can explain the 'why' depends on the amount of data available, and the quality.</p>

									<p>In this particular project, there were years of good quality data available on most products, but minimal price changes had taken place (promotional discounts being the main exception). There are a number if ways to deal with a lack of price changes. If there are similar products priced differently, we can look at the variation in order volumes between the products to get some idea. The best solution is to run a series of tests, where the prices on products are allowed to vary randomly within a predetermined range, over different time periods. Since this can be a very expensive test, the decision was made to do this in a small number of different products, and make the assumption that similar products have a similar price sensitivity.</p>

									<p>After doing this, price sensitivity scores could be determined for all products, and aggregated into product groups.</p>

									<p>Testing the accuracy of the scores involved estimating the change in volume for a given change in price, and then changing the price of the product and comparing the real order volume to the estimated order volume.</p>

									<p>The project allowed the client to improve margins by 5% on the products which had changed prices. Perhaps more importantly, the client was able to avoid price changes that damaged order volumes and market share.</p>
