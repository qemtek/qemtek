									<p> I initially joined Shift as the only data scientist in a fast paced startup, with the aim of leveraging the company's data to drive growth across the business through a number of high impact projects which are listed below.  The role covers the inception, development and productionisation of all data science related projects within the company, reporting directly to the CTO. From early 2023 I have overseen the creation of a data science department within the business and have begun mentoring junior data scientists. Notable projects include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p><b>Dynamic Pricing</b> - Introduced a machine learning approach to generating quote prices for customers. Compared to the original pricing structure, this model was able to improve margin by 20%, resulting in an average uplift of £20k per month. You can find a more detailed description of this project <a href="dynamic_pricing.html">here</a></p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p><b>Smart Routing</b> - Introduced an automated approach to route generation for delivery drivers (routes were traditionally generated manually by a team, costing ~£15k per month). As the business grew, the costs involved in manual routing became infeasible, making an automated approach the only feasible path. This is an extremely difficult field, as the number of possible routing combinations scales exponentially for a linear increase in delivery locations. Utilising Google's Operations Research Tools (OR-Tools) as a routing engine, I was able to build a routing platform which met the unique constraints of the business (different vehicle sizes, driver shift patterns, skillsets, business lines and more). At the time of writing, Smart Routing is responsible for routing 80% of Shift's orders, and has reduced the need for human interventions from 100% to 40%. In subsequent iterations we hope to reduce this even further.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p><b>Machine Learning Platform</b> - Development of a cloud-based machine learning platform for fast/secure deployment of models, which employs a uniform interface, regardless of the model. This has allowed for seamless integration of models into the backend, which has been a pain point in previous companies. This solution also alleviates other data scientists of any infrastructure work, which was important because the business did not have a dedicated infrastructure engineer at the time.</p>
