									<h2>Introduction</h2>

									<p>The client in this project was a logistics company who were looking to modernise. The business was making around 1000 deliveries per week and was continuing to grow. As the business grew, the complexity of building routes for their delivery fleet became increasingly difficult. As the number of deliveries increases, the number of possible ways that the deliveries can be batched increases exponentially. This makes manual routing infeasible, because the cost of hiring enough staff to build the routes quickly outpaces the income generated from the deliveries.</p>

									<p>With the help of Google's OR-Tools package I was able to build a route optimisation module (dubbed Smart Routing) to enable the business to scale without having to grow the operations team, saving Â£1000s per month in payroll costs. On top of this, route optimisation tools aim to generate the set of routes that minimises some 'cost', which in this case is the overall travel time. Because of this, the routes generated at scale were also more efficient than the routes generated manually (these systems can try 1000s of combinations of routes every second, which eclipses human abilities).</p>

									<h2>Theory</h2>

									<p>Vehicle Routing is a time of optimization problem, and is actually one of the most difficult problems to solve. As stated earlier, the number of possible combinations of drivers and deliveries increases exponentially for a linear increase in nodes (drivers or deliveries). To put this into context, if we double the number of deliveries, we quadruple the complexity of the problem. If we increase the number of deliveries by a factor of 10, we increase the complexity by a factor of 100. Because of this, it is very difficult to find the 'perfect' solution to such problems. Thankfully, we are able to get a relatively good result in a fraction of the time using some heuristics (assumptions) and relatively simple but ingenious techniques. The field of research which covers such techniques is called Constraint Programming, and is used to solve a wide range of problems including any type of scheduling problem, resource allocation, bridge building, circuit board verification and vehicle routing.</p>

									<p>Explained briefly, the idea of constraint programming is to set up a problem (in our case, we want to allocate deliveries to drivers), define a cost function (drive time in this case), and then add our constraints. A constraint is a rule which the optimiser must abide by in solving the problem. In this example, constraints include working hours of the drivers, collection and delivery windows and driver van capacity.</p>

									<p>Once the problem is defined, the optimiser will create an initial solution by following a basic rule, such as 'assign each job to the nearest driver, if all constraints are met'. This creates an initial (albiet poor) solution. From there, the optimiser will attempt to improve the solution by zooming in on certain areas, and swapping certain nodes. For example, the optimiser might look at 2 drivers and swap a job on each of their routes. If the swap improves the solution, the change is kept, otherwise it is reversed. In reality the 'swap' can be much more complex, involving many jobs, but this hopefully demonstrates the idea. These operations are applied thousands of times per second, allowing the total drive time to slowly converge towards a (near) optimal solution</p>

									<p>This process would be incredibly difficult to achieve for an individual, but thankfully the Operations Research team at Google have a package that allows us to create and solve such problems. The real difficulty involves taking an agnostic package such as this and building a routing module around it which can integrate with the clients existing backend infrastructure.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Objective</h2>
									<p>The overall objective of the project was to allow the business to scale without increasing the team. To measure success, the following KPIs were defined:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Deliveries Per Hour</b> - With scale, we are able to make more efficient routes for the drivers. Improvements in deliveries per hour roughly equates to improvements in margin, so is a key metric to track.</li>
										<li><b>Deliveries made on time</b> - It is important to track what % of deliveries are made on time to ensure that the routes generated by Smart Routing are feasible. We want to maximise deliveries per hour whilst also keeping this KPI high.</li>
										<li><b>Manual Intervention Rate</b> - This KPI relates to the % of bookings which needed some form of manual intervention. A manual intervention rate of 0% is near impossible because there is always the chance that things go wrong (traffic jams, flat tires and damaged goods are always a possibility). Despite this, being able to minimise this KPI tells us how successful we have been at automating the routing process.</li>
									</ul>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Challenges</h2>
									<p>The client has a huge codebase which includes a management dashboard for operations teams and an app for customer and drivers. To be successful the Smart Routing engine must be able to successfully communicate with each backend module. In addition to this, routes must be generated as fast as possible to ensure that they adapt to changing conditions, such as traffic.</p>

									<p>Traffic was a major issue in this project because the client had not paid for an API that includes traffic. Unfortunately due to the number of deliveries and drivers, using a traffic API would cost thousands per day and the coompany was not in a position to do this. Fortunately, all drivers had GPS tracking data saved over a number of years. In a separate project we were able to use this data to estimate the 'real' drive time between locations by feeding the historic data and time into a machine learning model and predicting a 'traffic adjustment'.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Deliverables</h2>

									<p>The final Smart Routing Engine was an enormous project built over the course of a year. Running approximately every 15 minutes, the system was able to pull in all deliveries and drivers, generate/update routes and communicate with the backend to send job requests to the relevant drivers. </p>

									<p>The engine was build in python and containerised using Docker (separate builds for Production and Development). The docker containers were then hosted as a service on AWS Elastic Container Service to ensure 24/7 availability and logging. Automated deployment was set up via GitHub Actions, which would rebuild the docker image and update the service whenever changes were made to the production or development branch. This massively reduces technical overhead for Data Scientists working on the project.</p>

									<p>In addition to the above, a KPI tracking dashboard was also generated to ensure that KPI's keep improving over time and to highlight any issues that may arise day-to-day.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Results</h2>

									<p>Since the launch of the Smart Routing Engine, the business orders have increased (at the time of writing) to ~1500 bookings per week, with no increase in team size. Manual intervention rates have been reduced from 100% to ~30%, giving the operations team more time to work on the issues that only humans can solve.
